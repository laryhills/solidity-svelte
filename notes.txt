// Using external libraries requires
// truffle init does'nt create package.json
 - npm init dir
 - install library
 - import in contract file


// Migrating means changing schema of blockchain
// schema to accomodate contract
 - Deploy contracts with -> truffle migrate


 // For Frontend
 - svelte interacts with wallet via a json file 
 - this json file os built by truffles
 - truffles need to know where to build the contracts


// Using truffle console
 - enter console -> truffle console
 - retrieve contract and assign to variable -> variableName = await ContractName.deployed()
 - you must interact with blockchain in a async manner
 - address of contract -> variableName.address
 - getting a public var in contract -> variableName.var() ** as a <BN > big number
 - you can parse BN to int with  -> var await variableName.var()
 - var.toNumber() or toString() or toArray() or  toJSON()
